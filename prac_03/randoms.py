What did you see on line 1?
On line 1, the smallest number I could have seen was 5 and the
largest was 20.

What did you see on line 2?
On line 2, the smallest number I could have seen was 3
and the largest was 9. No, line 2 couldn't have produced

What did you see on line 3?
On line 3, the smallest number I could have seen was 2.5
and the largest was 5.5.
